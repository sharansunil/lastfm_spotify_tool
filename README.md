# spotify+lastfm integration and visualization tool

This is a project/tool to integrate spotify and lastfm apis' to get a summary of your Spotify+LastFM libraries.
Please feel free to give feedback and advice about my code be it optimisation, cleaning or more features!

### TODO
- Build unit and integration tests
- Create website
- Create a more secure way of storing data

### What does each python file do?
- For readability, the files were split into functions and classes.
- BaseClasses contains information to generate the classes. 
- LastFmFunctions and SpotifyFunctions do what the names say. 
- Execution is handled only at run.py.
