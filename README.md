# spotify+lastfm integration and visualization tool

This is a project/tool to integrate spotify and lastfm api's to get a cohesive view of your Spotify library.

The code is split into multiple files. Helper functions for individual api's can be found in their distinct python files, named accordingly. 

Classes for credential and generator loading can be found in BaseClasses.

For simple execution and obtaining various csv's and dataframes to work with, simply use run.py. The only inputs required will be your credentials and any settings you wish to toggle.
